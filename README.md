====

Apply qualitative spatial temporal relationships between detected trajectories and static objects, per ROI. 


Packages:
-------------
Relational Learner - used for online analysis of trajectory data. 

Offline relational learner - used to analyse data offline. 

Human trajectory classifier - used to classify whether a detection is a person or not.

Time analysis - use to fit a 1d model over the timestamps of trajectory detections, to assess temporal abnormalality
